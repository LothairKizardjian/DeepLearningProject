If Tensorflow 2.0 is intalled you should be able to run golois.py by commenting out the line 'import golois'
It uses a set of 100 000 examples saved in numpy arrays to train the network
The games used to generate the training data are self play games of Facebook ELF opengo Go program
In games.data there are 500 000 such games
It means there are potentially 98 000 000 different training examples in total
In order to get dynamic batches that randomly choose 100 000 examples out of the 98 000 000 ones you should install Pybind and run compile.sh (on Ubuntu) or compileMAC.sh on MAC
Then you can import golois and call golois.getBatch to have dynamically built batches
The maximum number of trainable parameters allowed for your model is 1 000 000
Enjoy!
